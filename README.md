# RotateCamera

This project includes sample codes and assets to demonstrate rotating camera on Unity 
by using gyroscopes and compasses of mobile devices. 

## How to use
If you attach RotateWithGyro.cs with your camera, 
you can rotate it by moving your mobile devices using only gyro.   
If you attach RotateWithCompass.cs, 
you can look around, but also correct the direction based on compass data.  

## Note
I checked these codes work on Android and iOS devices.
